        { type: 'p', text: 'The conceptual origins of programming predate electronics. In the 1840s, <strong>Charles Babbage</strong> designed the "Analytical Engine," a mechanical computer. It was his collaborator, mathematician <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong>, who recognized its full potential. She authored an algorithm to compute Bernoulli numbers on the Engine, making her the first person to document a sequence of operations for a general-purpose computing machine. She correctly foresaw that such a machine could manipulate not just numbers, but any symbol, a foundational concept of modern computing.' },

        { type: 'p', text: 'The end of World War II marked the beginning of the electronic computing era with machines like <strong>ENIAC</strong>. These early computers were programmed by manually setting thousands of switches and rewiring physical cablesâ€”a laborious and error-prone process. The crucial innovation came from Rear Admiral <strong>Grace Hopper</strong>, who in 1952 developed the A-0 compiler. This was a revolutionary tool that could translate symbolic code into machine code, dramatically increasing programmer productivity and paving the way for the development of more abstract programming languages.' },

        { type: 'p', text: 'As software projects grew in scale, their complexity became unmanageable, leading to what was termed the "software crisis." In response, the paradigm of <strong>structured programming</strong> emerged, championed by figures like Edsger Dijkstra, promoting the use of control flow structures like if/else, for, and while loops to improve code clarity and reduce errors.' },

Its combination of high-level structured programming with low-level access to memory made it uniquely powerful for systems programming. The UNIX operating system was famously rewritten in C, and C\'s influence on virtually every subsequent language is immeasurable.' },
